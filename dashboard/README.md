# SpectraOps Dashboard

This is the web UI for SpectraOps. It will provide unified views for errors, sessions, visual diffs, feature flags, and QA results.

## Tech Stack Proposal

- React (with Vite or Next.js)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (for rapid styling)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## TODO

- Scaffold React app
- Set up routing and authentication
- Connect to API gateway
- Add placeholder pages for each feature
